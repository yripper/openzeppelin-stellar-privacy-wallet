/**
 * Hybrid event source: RPC for the recent tail, the Goldsky indexer for the
 * portion older than the RPC's ~7-day retention window.
 *
 * Strategy ("RPC tip + indexer backfill"):
 *   next = cursor ? cursorLedger(cursor)+1 : fromLedger
 *   if indexer configured AND next < rpcOldest:
 *     - indexer covers [next, rpcOldest-1]   (only it has these)
 *     - RPC covers      [rpcOldest, head]    (clean ledger boundary)
 *   else:
 *     - RPC only, from the stored cursor (warm) or clamp(fromLedger, rpcOldest)
 *
 * Because the indexer leg ends at `rpcOldest-1` and the RPC leg starts at
 * `rpcOldest`, the two ranges are disjoint by construction — correctness does
 * NOT depend on cross-source id equality. {@link dedupeById} is only a
 * belt-and-suspenders guard for the boundary ledger (and because
 * `StateEngine.apply` is not idempotent, a stray duplicate would double-count).
 *
 * The indexer is OPTIONAL: when `indexer` is `undefined`, this degrades to
 * RPC-only behavior (pre-window history simply unavailable) — a deliberate
 * configuration choice. But when a *configured* indexer's backfill call
 * throws (a transient network/Worker hiccup), the error PROPAGATES instead of
 * degrading silently: StateEngine.sync() would otherwise still complete using
 * only the RPC leg and persist its cursor, which permanently commits every
 * future sync to the warm, indexer-skipping path (see below) — turning one
 * transient failure into unrecoverable data loss for that client.
