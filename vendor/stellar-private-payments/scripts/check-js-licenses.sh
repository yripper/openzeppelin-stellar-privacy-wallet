# Full-tree JS license scan (sh+jq port of the former check-js-licenses.py).
#
# Scans every package in the npm lockfiles of the shipped JS workspaces
# (app/, sdk/web/) against .github/js-license-policy.json
# (allowlist / denylist / exceptions) and writes js-license-scan-report.json
# to the repo root.
#
# Exit codes: 0 = compliant, 1 = violations found, 2 = policy/jq missing or a
# target lockfile is missing (a missing target would otherwise silently drop
# coverage while still reporting SUCCESS).
#
# Matching semantics (must stay in sync with the policy file's exceptions):
#   - package name = lockfile path with all "node_modules/" stripped, then the
#     last path segment for bare packages, or the last TWO segments when the
#     second-to-last starts with "@" (preserves scope for nested copies like
#     foo/node_modules/@scope/bar -> "@scope/bar", and chalk/node_modules/
#     supports-color -> "supports-color");
#   - an exception matches on either that derived name or the full lockfile path;
#   - an exception applies only to the lockfile named by its "target" field
#     (an exception without "target" applies repo-wide — avoid unless intended);
#   - a license is matched EXACTLY against the allowlist/denylist as one string
#     — compound SPDX expressions like "(MIT OR Apache-2.0)" are not evaluated,
#     so a dependency reporting one is treated as a single, distinct license
#     value. If a real dependency ever needs this, add the literal compound
#     string to the allowlist (already done for "(MIT AND BSD-3-Clause)",
#     used by app's sha.js) rather than teaching this script to parse boolean
#     SPDX expressions — no dependency has needed OR-expression evaluation so
#     far, so that logic isn't worth the added complexity until one does.
