-- SQLite schema for local app state.

-- Data flow:
-- - Indexer ingestion: `raw_contract_events` stores chain events as fetched from RPC, and
--   `indexing_metadata` stores the RPC pagination cursor.
-- - Event processing: raw events are parsed into derived chain-state tables
--   (`pool_commitments`, `pool_nullifiers`, `public_keys`, `asp_membership_leaves`).
-- - User processing: derived chain state is scanned/decrypted into per-account `user_notes`,
--   with scan progress tracked in the scan-state tables.

-- Contracts known to this local database.
--
-- Storage is event-driven: contracts are inserted on first observation.
